Honeytoken: Invisible Traps for Cyber Intruders

Overview

Honeytokens are deceptive security mechanisms designed to detect unauthorized access and potential cyber threats. This project implements a honeytoken system that redirects unauthorized access attempts to a fake folder, captures the attacker's face via a webcam, and sends an email alert with the captured image.

Features

Fake Folder Redirection: Sensitive files are hidden, and unauthorized access attempts are directed to a decoy folder.

Webcam Capture: The attacker's image is captured using the system's webcam.

Email Alert: An email notification is sent with the captured image to alert the system owner of the intrusion.

Stealthy Monitoring: Operates discreetly to avoid detection by intruders.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

smtplib for email services

OS and shutil libraries for file operations

The **honeytoken.py** script is responsible for continuously monitoring a designated directory for unauthorized access. When an intrusion is detected, it activates the systemâ€™s webcam to capture an image of the intruder and sends an email alert with the captured image attached. Additionally, **link.sh** is used to redirect sensitive files to a decoy folder, ensuring that unauthorized users are lured into interacting with the honeytoken system. This combination helps in identifying and tracking potential security threats in real time.
